# Deep-Learning-for-Tabular-Data

Motivation:  

I create this repository for my independent study of State-of-the-Art deep learning applications on tabular data (2nd place worldwide ranking on Kaggle Competitions, etc.) To explore the benefit of time saved moving from (excessive feature engineering effort + machine learning) to (reasonable feature engineering effort + deep learning)   

Background:  In response to a paradigm shift in Kaggle community where deep learning starting to outperform traditional machine learning methods, after the advent of AlexNet.

From my experience doing data science and AI work, resonating with the philosophy from Jeremy Howard, founder of fast.ai, I believe in approaching AI subjects from both a top-down and button-up perspective, in that:

Top-down: You start from the end goal in mind, identify use cases of the subject to establish a sense of purpose during the study.

Button-up: You develop a firm grasp of each building block to acquire ability to accommodate for future use case variations.

Thus, you avoid shifting focus of the craft of AI to necessary but nonessential demonstration of math prowess; and you avoid remaining superficial and inflexible if you limit your attention only to use cases, utilizing useful but high-level packages that hide away what goes on under the hood.

This repository focuses on the button-up perspective. For more top-down approach, please refer to my other 2 repositories:
