# Deep-Learning-for-Tabular-Data

Motivation:  
I create this repository for my independent study of State-of-the-Art deep learning applications on tabular data (2nd place worldwide ranking on Kaggle Competitions, etc.) To explore the benefit of time saved moving from (excessive feature engineering effort + machine learning) to (reasonable feature engineering effort + deep learning)   

Background:  In response to a paradigm shift in Kaggle community where deep learning starting to outperform traditional machine learning methods, after the advent of AlexNet.
